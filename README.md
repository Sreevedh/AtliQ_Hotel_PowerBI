This Power BI project is based on a fictional hotel **AtliQ Grands** (imaginary hotel), designed as part of a case study by [Codebasics](https://www.codebasics.io/). The objective was to analyze the hotel's **revenue performances** and provide business insights to stakeholders using interactive dashboards.

## 🚀 Project Objective

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

Task:  

You are a data analyst who has been provided with sample data and a mock-up dashboard to work on the following task. You can download all relevant documents from the download section.

Create the metrics according to the metric list.
Create a dashboard according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders.
